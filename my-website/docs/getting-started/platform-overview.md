# Edge Platform Overview

## Introduction to the Edge Platform

The Edge Platform provides a comprehensive, cloud-native solution for deploying and managing applications at the edge. Built on Kubernetes, it offers the scalability, resilience, and operational efficiency needed for modern distributed applications.

## Key Capabilities

- **Cloud-Native Foundation**: Built on Kubernetes with support for containers and virtual machines
- **Edge Computing**: Optimized for edge deployments with reduced latency and improved performance
- **Application Modernization**: Tools and frameworks for migrating legacy applications to cloud-native architectures
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Auto-scaling, load balancing, and resource optimization
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability

## Platform Architecture

The platform supports multiple deployment patterns:

### Container-Based Workloads
- Native Kubernetes deployments
- Helm chart packaging
- Microservices architectures

### Virtual Machine Workloads
- KubeVirt integration for VM management
- Support for legacy applications
- Hybrid container-VM deployments

### Application Migration Paths
- Lift-and-shift VM deployments
- Containerization strategies
- Microservices decomposition

## Getting Started

This documentation will guide you through:

1. **Platform Fundamentals**: Understanding core concepts and capabilities
2. **Application Modernization**: Strategies for moving to microservices
3. **Migration Playbooks**: Step-by-step guides for different migration scenarios
