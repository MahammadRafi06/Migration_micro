# Architecture and Implementation

This guide covers the key architectural patterns and implementation strategies for building effective microservices systems. Make sure you've read the [Microservices Fundamentals](./fundamentals) first.

## Architectural Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern

An **API Gateway** acts as a single entry point that routes requests to appropriate microservices. It also handles common concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.

**Benefits:** Simplified client interaction, centralized security, request routing.  
**Considerations:** Potential single point of failure, performance bottleneck.

### Service Mesh Pattern

A **Service Mesh** is an infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, providing features like load balancing, service discovery, encryption, and observability.

**Benefits:** Consistent communication policies, enhanced security, improved observability.  
**Considerations:** Additional complexity, performance overhead.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The **Circuit Breaker** pattern prevents cascading failures by monitoring service calls. It "opens the circuit" when failure thresholds are exceeded, allowing systems to fail fast and recover gracefully.

**Benefits:** Improved resilience, faster failure detection, graceful degradation.  
**Implementation:** Monitor failure rates, open circuit when thresholds exceeded, periodic health checks.

### Saga Pattern

The **Saga** pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services using a sequence of local transactions, with compensation mechanisms for rollback scenarios.

**Benefits:** Maintains data consistency without distributed transactions, improved performance.  
**Types:** Choreography-based (event-driven) and Orchestration-based (centralized coordinator).

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**CQRS** separates read and write operations, allowing different models and databases to be optimized for queries versus commands.

**Benefits:** Optimized performance for different operations, scalability, flexibility.  
**Considerations:** Increased complexity, eventual consistency challenges.

## Implementation Considerations

### Service Boundaries

Define clear service boundaries based on business domains using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. Services should have high cohesion within and loose coupling between boundaries.

**Identification Strategies:**
* Analyze business capabilities and workflows
* Identify data that changes together
* Consider team structures and ownership
* Evaluate transaction boundaries

### Service Sizing

Balance service granularity to avoid both overly fine-grained services (which increase communication overhead) and overly coarse-grained services (which reduce flexibility).

**Guidelines:**
* Services should be manageable by a small team (2-8 people)
* Consider development and operational complexity
* Balance autonomy with coordination needs

### Service Discovery

Implement mechanisms for services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.

**Approaches:**
* **Client-side discovery** with a service registry
* **Server-side discovery** with a load balancer
* **Service mesh** with built-in discovery

### Configuration Management

Externalize configuration to enable environment-specific deployments without code changes.

**Best Practices:**
* Use environment variables or configuration services
* Implement configuration versioning and rollback
* Separate secrets management from general configuration

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

In **synchronous communication**, the client waits for a direct response from the service.

* **HTTP/REST APIs:** Standard for request-response, using HTTP methods and status codes
* **GraphQL:** Allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching
* **gRPC:** High-performance RPC using Protocol Buffers, providing type safety

### Asynchronous Communication

**Asynchronous communication** uses messages or events, allowing services to process requests without waiting for an immediate response.

* **Message Queues:** Point-to-point communication for reliable message delivery
* **Event Streaming:** Publish-subscribe pattern where services publish events to topics
* **Event Sourcing:** Store all changes to application state as a sequence of events

### Communication Best Practices

* **Idempotency:** Design operations to be safely retryable without side effects
* **Timeouts and Retries:** Implement appropriate timeout and retry strategies with exponential backoff
* **Bulkhead Pattern:** Isolate critical resources to prevent failures in one area from affecting others
* **API Versioning:** Maintain backward compatibility while allowing API evolution

## Data Management

### Database per Service

Each microservice should **own its data and database schema**, ensuring loose coupling and independent evolution.

**Benefits:** Technology choice flexibility, independent scaling, clear ownership.  
**Challenges:** Data consistency, cross-service queries, transaction management.

### Data Consistency Patterns

* **Eventual Consistency:** Accept that data will be consistent eventually, designing systems to handle temporary inconsistencies
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use domain events to maintain consistency across service boundaries
* **Distributed Transactions:** Use patterns like Saga or Two-Phase Commit when strong consistency is required

### Data Synchronization

* **Event Publishing:** Services publish events when data changes, allowing other services to maintain local copies
* **Data Replication:** Replicate data across services for read optimization, accepting eventual consistency
* **CQRS with Event Sourcing:** Separate command and query models, using events as the source of truth
