## Pricing Components

### Compute Resources
- **CPU Hours**: Per vCPU per hour usage.
- **Memory**: Per GB of RAM per hour.
- **GPU Resources**: Per GPU unit per hour (when available).
- **Storage I/O**: Per operation and throughput.

### Storage Costs
- **Persistent Storage**: Per GB per month.
- **Backup Storage**: Per GB per month with retention tiers.
- **Data Transfer**: Ingress/egress charges between regions.

### Network Usage
- **Bandwidth**: Per GB of data transfer.
- **Load Balancing**: Per load balancer per hour.
- **VPN Connections**: Per tunnel per hour.

### Platform Services
