## **7. Advanced Considerations and Troubleshooting**

This section provides additional steps for a more robust deployment and guidance on resolving common issues.

### **7.1. Image Management for Production**

For production deployments, simply relying on local Docker images is insufficient. You need an image registry.

* Build Docker Images: Ensure your Dockerfile is optimized.

| docker build \-t your-registry/your-image-name:tag .\# Explanation: Builds your Docker image and tags it with your registry's address, image name, and a specific tag (e.g., version number). |
| :---- |

* 
* Push to a Container Registry: Push your built images to a public or private container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), Amazon ECR).

| docker push your-registry/your-image-name:tag\# Explanation: Uploads your tagged Docker image to the specified container registry, making it accessible to your Kubernetes cluster. |
| :---- |

* 
* Update Kubernetes Manifests: Change the image field in your Deployment manifests to point to the registry path (e.g., image: your-registry/your-image\-name:tag).
* ImagePullSecrets: If using a private registry, configure imagePullSecrets in your Deployment manifest to allow Kubernetes to authenticate and pull the images.

### **7.2. Kubernetes Dashboard**

The Kubernetes Dashboard provides a web-based UI for managing and monitoring your cluster.

* Enable Dashboard (Minikube):

| minikube dashboard\# Explanation: Opens the Kubernetes Dashboard in your default web browser. Minikube automatically handles proxying the dashboard service. |
| :---- |

* 
* This will launch a browser window showing the dashboard, where you can visually inspect your deployments, pods, services, and other resources.

### **7.3. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

When deploying to Kubernetes, you might encounter issues. Here are some common problems and basic kubectl commands for debugging:

* Pod Stuck in Pending State:
  * Cause: Often due to insufficient resources (CPU/memory), unfulfilled PVCs, or scheduling issues.
  * Debug: kubectl **describe** pod \<pod-**name**\> (check Events section for reasons), kubectl get events.
* Pod Stuck in ImagePullBackOff or ImagePullBackOff:
  * Cause: Kubernetes cannot pull the Docker image. This could be due to an incorrect image name/tag, private registry authentication issues, or the image not existing.
  * Debug: kubectl **describe** pod \<pod-**name**\> (check Events for pull errors), verify image name and registry access.
* Application Not Accessible (Service Issues):
  * Cause: Incorrect service type, port mapping issues, or firewall rules.
  * Debug: kubectl get svc (check **TYPE**, **PORT**(S)), kubectl **describe** svc \<service-**name**\>, kubectl **logs** \<pod-**name**\> (check application logs for listening port).
* Application Errors (Container Issues):
  * Cause: Application code errors, incorrect environment variables, or database connectivity issues.
  * Debug: kubectl logs \<pod-name\> (view application logs), kubectl exec \-**it** \<pod-name\> \-- /bin/bash (access container shell for debugging).

### **7.4. Security Best Practices**

* Secrets Management: Always use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data. Consider using external secret management solutions (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production.
* Network Policies: Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to control traffic flow between pods and external services, enhancing security.
* Resource Limits: Define **resources**.requests and **resources**.limits for all containers to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure stable performance.
* Least Privilege: Configure Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to grant only the necessary permissions to users and service accounts.

## **8. Cleanup (Optional)**

To remove all deployed Kubernetes resources and stop/delete your Minikube cluster, follow these steps:

| kubectl delete \-f .\# Explanation: Deletes all Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, PVCs, etc.) that were created from the YAML files in the current directory. This effectively uninstalls your application from the cluster.minikube stop armadalocal\# Explanation: Stops the Minikube cluster VM, freeing up system resources. The cluster state is preserved.minikube delete armadalocal\# Explanation: Permanently deletes the Minikube cluster VM and all associated data. Use this when you no longer need the cluster. |
