# Edge Platform API Reference: A Practical Guide

The Edge Platform API lets you automate, integrate, and manage your edge clusters and applications programmatically. This guide covers authentication, core endpoints, example requests, error handling, and best practices—everything you need to get started and succeed with the API.

---

## What Is the Edge Platform API?

The Edge Platform API is a RESTful interface for managing clusters, deploying applications, and retrieving status and metrics. Use it to:
- Automate cluster and app management from your own tools or CI/CD pipelines
- Integrate edge resources with external systems
- Build custom dashboards or monitoring solutions

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Obtain API Credentials**
- **Bearer Token:** Usually obtained via SSO or OAuth login.
- **API Key:** Generated in the platform dashboard (for service accounts or automation).

### 2. **Base URL**
- All requests are made to: `https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/`

### 3. **Test Your Access**
Try listing clusters to verify your credentials:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters
```
If you get a list of clusters, you're ready to go!

---

## Authentication

### Bearer Token Authentication
- **When to use:** For interactive users or short-lived automation.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters
  ```

### API Key Authentication
- **When to use:** For long-lived automation, CI/CD, or service accounts.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters
  ```

---

## Cluster Management API

### List Clusters
- **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/clusters`
- **Description:** Returns all clusters you have access to.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "clusters": [
      {
        "id": "edge-west-1",
        "name": "Edge West 1",
        "region": "us-west-1",
        "status": "active"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Use case:**
  > You want to see all available clusters before deploying an app.

---

### Create Cluster
- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/clusters`
- **Description:** Creates a new edge cluster.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "edge-east-1",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "node_count": 3
  }
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name":"edge-east-1","region":"us-east-1","node_count":3}' \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters
  ```
- **Use case:**
  > You need to provision a new cluster for a new region or project.

---

## Application Management API

### Deploy Application
- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/applications`
- **Description:** Deploys a new application to a cluster.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "myapp",
    "image": "myapp:v1.0.0",
    "replicas": 3,
    "resources": {
      "cpu": "500m",
      "memory": "512Mi"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name":"myapp","image":"myapp:v1.0.0","replicas":3,"resources":{"cpu":"500m","memory":"512Mi"}}' \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters/edge-west-1/applications
  ```
- **Use case:**
  > You want to deploy a new version of your app to a specific cluster.

---

### Get Application Status
- **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/applications/{app_name}`
- **Description:** Retrieves the status and details of a deployed application.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
       https://api.edge-platform.com/v1/clusters/edge-west-1/applications/myapp
  ```
- **Use case:**
  > You want to check if your deployment succeeded and see resource usage.

## Error Codes & Troubleshooting

| Code | Meaning                  | How to Fix                                      |
|------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request              | Check your request body and parameters.         |
| 401  | Unauthorized             | Check your token or API key.                    |
| 403  | Forbidden                | You lack permission for this action.            |
| 404  | Not Found                | Resource does not exist or wrong endpoint.      |
| 429  | Rate Limit Exceeded      | Slow down requests or upgrade your plan.        |
| 500  | Internal Server Error    | Try again later or contact support.             |

- **Tip:** Always check the error message in the response body for more details.

---

## Rate Limits

- **Standard:** 1000 requests per hour
- **Premium:** 10000 requests per hour
- **Best Practice:** Implement retry logic and exponential backoff in your scripts.

---

## Best Practices

- **Secure Your Credentials:** Never hard-code tokens or API keys in source code.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables or secret managers.
- **Paginate Large Results:** Use pagination parameters for endpoints that return many items.
- **Monitor Usage:** Track your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits.
- **Automate with CI/CD:** Integrate API calls into your deployment pipelines for repeatability.
