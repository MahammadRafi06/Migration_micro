# Deploying Docker Compose Applications to KubeVirt VMs

This guide provides a detailed approach for deploying your existing Docker Compose configurations into Virtual Machines managed by KubeVirt on a Kubernetes cluster. This strategy allows you to leverage your existing Docker Compose setup while benefiting from Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities for the underlying VMs.

## Introduction

Docker Compose is excellent for local development and orchestrating multi-container applications on a single host. However, when you need to scale, ensure high availability, and manage complex deployments in a production environment, Kubernetes becomes the de-facto standard. 

KubeVirt extends Kubernetes to manage traditional Virtual Machines alongside containers. This guide will walk you through the process of encapsulating your Docker Compose application within a KubeVirt VM.

:::tip Key Benefit
This approach allows you to migrate to Kubernetes without having to refactor your Docker Compose applications into native Kubernetes resources immediately.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- **Basic understanding of Docker Compose**: Familiarity with services, volumes, networks, and environment variables.
- **Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts**: Familiarity with Pods, Deployments, Services, Volumes, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

### Required Components
- **A Docker Compose file**: The application you intend to deploy.
- **kubectl installed and configured**: To interact with a Kubernetes cluster (local like Minikube/Kind, or cloud-based).
- **A running Kubernetes Cluster**: With sufficient resources (CPU, Memory, Storage).
- **KubeVirt installed and configured** on your Kubernetes cluster: This typically involves installing the KubeVirt operator and its Custom Resources.
- **virtctl installed**: The KubeVirt command-line tool.
- **A method to create and modify VM disk images**: Tools like qemu-img, virt-builder, or a temporary VM environment (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, or even another KubeVirt VM) for creating your "golden image."
- **Containerized Data Importer (CDI) installed**: CDI is crucial for importing VM disk images into PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) in Kubernetes.

:::note
The installation process for KubeVirt and CDI is outside the scope of this guide. Please refer to the [KubeVirt documentation](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/) for detailed installation instructions.

## Understanding the Strategy: Docker Compose inside a VM

Instead of translating each Docker Compose service into a Kubernetes Deployment and Service, this approach involves:

1. **Creating a "Golden VM Image"**: A virtual machine disk image (e.g., QCOW2) that has a base operating system, Docker, and Docker Compose installed.

2. **Encapsulating Docker Compose**: Your docker-compose.yml file and application code will reside inside this VM.

3. **KubeVirt Management**: KubeVirt will manage the lifecycle of this VM (starting, stopping, migrating) just like it manages any other VM.

4. **Kubernetes Service Exposure**: A standard Kubernetes Service will expose the necessary ports of the KubeVirt VM to the rest of your cluster or externally.

### Key Advantages of This Approach

1. **Minimal Refactoring**: Keep your Docker Compose application as-is, without having to refactor it into Kubernetes-native resources.

2. **Isolation**: Each VM provides better isolation than containers, which can be beneficial for security and resource management.

3. **Familiar Environment**: Your application runs in the same environment as it did before, potentially reducing unexpected compatibility issues.

4. **Gradual Migration**: This approach can serve as a transitional step toward a fully Kubernetes-native deployment in the future.

### Key Considerations

1. **Resource Overhead**: VMs require more resources than containers. You'll need to account for the additional CPU, memory, and storage requirements.

2. **Performance**: There's an additional virtualization layer, which may impact performance compared to running containers directly on Kubernetes.

3. **Maintenance**: Updates to the VM OS, Docker, or Docker Compose require rebuilding and redeploying the entire VM image.

## Next Steps

In the next section, we'll cover how to prepare your Docker Compose application for deployment in a KubeVirt VM and create the base VM disk image that will host your application.
