# Migration Playbooks Overview

This section provides comprehensive, step-by-step guidance for migrating applications to the Edge Platform. Each playbook is designed to address specific migration scenarios with practical examples and best practices.

## Available Migration Paths

### A. Monolith to Microservices Migration

Transform monolithic applications into microservices architecture for improved scalability, maintainability, and team velocity.

#### When to Use
- Large, complex applications with multiple business domains
- Teams looking to improve development velocity
- Applications requiring independent scaling of components

#### Key Benefits
- Independent service deployment
- Technology diversity
- Improved fault isolation
- Enhanced scalability

### B. Docker Compose to Kubernetes Migration

Migrate multi-container applications from Docker Compose to Kubernetes for production-ready orchestration.

#### Developer Guide
Step-by-step technical instructions for developers converting Docker Compose files to Kubernetes manifests.

#### Operational Runbook
Practical operational procedures for deployment teams managing the migration process.

### C. Docker Compose to Helm Charts

Package Docker Compose applications as Helm charts for better versioning, templating, and deployment management.

#### Benefits
- Template-based configuration
- Version management
- Easy rollbacks
- Simplified deployments

### D. Docker Compose to Virtual Machines

Deploy Docker Compose applications in KubeVirt virtual machines for legacy compatibility while leveraging Kubernetes orchestration.

#### Use Cases
- Applications with complex system dependencies
- Gradual migration strategies
- Hybrid container-VM architectures

## Choosing the Right Migration Path

Consider these factors when selecting your migration approach:

### Application Complexity

#### Simple Applications
Direct containerization

#### Complex Monoliths
Consider microservices decomposition

#### Legacy Dependencies
VM-based deployment

### Team Readiness

#### Kubernetes Experience
Direct migration to Kubernetes

#### Limited Cloud-Native Experience
Start with lift-and-shift

### Business Requirements

#### Rapid Migration
Lift-and-shift approach

#### Long-term Modernization
Microservices transformation

#### Incremental Changes
Hybrid approaches

### Risk Tolerance

#### Low Risk
VM-based migration

#### Medium Risk
Containerization

#### Higher Risk
Full microservices transformation

## Migration Process Overview

Each migration playbook follows a structured approach:

### 1. Assessment
Analyze current application architecture

### 2. Planning
Define migration strategy and timeline

### 3. Preparation
Set up tools and environments

### 4. Execution
Implement the migration

### 5. Validation
Test and verify the migrated application

### 6. Optimization
Fine-tune performance and operations

## Getting Started

Choose the migration path that best fits your application and organizational needs:

### Migration Paths

#### Monolith to Microservices
For large application transformations

#### Docker Compose to Kubernetes
For containerized applications

#### Docker Compose to Helm Charts
For better package management

#### Docker Compose to Virtual Machines
For legacy compatibility

Each playbook provides detailed guidance, practical examples, and troubleshooting tips to ensure successful migration to the Edge Platform.
