# Runbook: Migrating a Monolith to Microservices for AEP Kubernetes

## Purpose and Audience

This document is crafted as a detailed, step-by-step runbook for technical teams—including architects, developers, and operations engineers—who are actively involved in onboarding their monolithic applications into AEP. While we'll walk through a simplified example to clarify core principles and procedures, the insights here are foundational and directly applicable to even the most complex enterprise systems you might be working with.

## Migration Approaches Comparison

| Approach | Description | Strategy | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **VM-Based Migration (Lift-and-Shift)** | Deploy the entire monolithic application as a Virtual Machine(s) on AEP with minimal code changes. The application runs in its current state within a containerized VM environment. Supports both Linux and Windows VMs. | - AS-IS Migration<br/>- Containerize existing VM images<br/>- Deploy using VM orchestration tools (e.g., KubeVirt)<br/>- Maintain existing architecture and dependencies<br/>- Implement basic monitoring and scaling at VM level | - Fastest time-to-market<br/>- Minimal development effort<br/>- Low risk of introducing bugs<br/>- Preserves existing integrations<br/>- Quick ROI on platform migration<br/>- Maintains current operational procedures | - Limited cloud-native benefits<br/>- Inefficient resource utilization<br/>- Monolithic scaling limitations<br/>- Higher infrastructure costs<br/>- Reduced fault isolation<br/>- Technology debt accumulation<br/>- Limited auto-scaling capabilities |
| **Complete Microservices Transformation** | Full decomposition of monolithic application into independently deployable microservices, each with dedicated databases and cloud-native patterns. AEP Currently supports only Linux Containers. | - 100% Microservices<br/>- Domain-driven service decomposition<br/>- Database-per-service pattern<br/>- Event-driven architecture implementation<br/>- Container-native deployment<br/>- API-first design approach<br/>- Comprehensive observability stack | - Maximum cloud-native benefits<br/>- Independent service scaling<br/>- Technology diversity per service<br/>- Superior fault isolation<br/>- Enhanced development velocity<br/>- Optimal resource efficiency<br/>- Future-proof architecture<br/>- DevOps and CI/CD alignment | - Significant development investment<br/>- Extended timeline (6-18 months)<br/>- Complex data migration requirements<br/>- Distributed systems complexity<br/>- Substantial team upskilling needed<br/>- Higher initial operational overhead<br/>- Service mesh complexity |
| **Hybrid Workload Migration** | Strategic combination of VM-based deployment for core legacy components while extracting specific functionalities into microservices. Gradual transformation using the "Strangler Fig" pattern. Windows/Linux VMs + Linux Containers | - Hybrid Modernization<br/>- Core monolith remains as VM<br/>- New features as microservices<br/>- Gradual service extraction<br/>- API gateway for unified access<br/>- Progressive database separation<br/>- Phased cloud-native adoption | - Balanced risk and reward<br/>- Incremental investment model<br/>- Faster initial deployment<br/>- Continuous delivery<br/>- Gradual team capability building<br/>- Reduced business disruption<br/>- Flexibility in modernization pace<br/>- Lower initial complexity | - Architectural complexity<br/>- Dual operational models<br/>- Data consistency challenges<br/>- Extended overall timeline<br/>- Service boundary evolution<br/>- Technical debt management<br/>- Integration overhead |

## Why Microservices on Kubernetes?

Moving to a microservices architecture orchestrated by Kubernetes unlocks a world of significant benefits for your applications and teams:

- **Scalability:** Imagine being able to scale just the parts of your application that are under heavy demand, rather than the entire system. That's the beauty of microservices, leading to optimized resource use.
- **Resilience:** When one small service experiences an issue, it's isolated. This prevents a domino effect that could bring down your entire application, making your system much more robust.
- **Agility:** With smaller, independent services, development, testing, and deployment cycles become significantly faster. Your teams can move with greater speed and confidence.
- **Technology Diversity:** Teams gain the freedom to choose the best technology stack for each individual service, fostering innovation and leveraging specialized tools.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Kubernetes offers powerful capabilities for automation, self-healing, and declarative management, simplifying complex operational tasks.

## A Note on Your Migration Strategy

It's important to keep in mind that real-world enterprise applications from ISVs are typically far more complex in their architecture, data management, integration, and operational needs than the simplified example we'll explore in this runbook.

While our focus here is on a full microservices transformation for clarity, don't overlook the value of running existing Virtual Machines (VMs) on Kubernetes (using KubeVirt). This can be a quicker initial step to get your VM-based applications onto Kubernetes. While it might mean you don't immediately reap all the benefits of cloud-native containerization, it's a solid start. A very effective strategy we often see is to begin by running your current VMs on Kubernetes to achieve an immediate migration, and then gradually modularize and containerize those workloads over time. This phased approach allows you to fully leverage Kubernetes' cloud-native features for scalability and operational efficiency when you're ready.
