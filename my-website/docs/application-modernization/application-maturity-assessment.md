# Microservices Adoption Maturity Levels for Partners

We recognize that our partners are at different stages in their adoption and implementation of microservices. To accurately assess their current capabilities and offer the most effective, tailored support, we have established the following microservices maturity levels:

<MaturityLevels />

## Assessment and Support

Use this maturity framework to:

- **Assess current state** - Identify where partners currently stand in their microservices journey
- **Plan progression** - Understand the natural evolution path from one stage to the next
- **Tailor support** - Provide appropriate guidance and resources based on maturity level
- **Set expectations** - Establish realistic timelines and outcomes for each stage

Each stage represents a significant milestone in the microservices adoption journey, with distinct characteristics, challenges, and capabilities that require different approaches and support strategies.
