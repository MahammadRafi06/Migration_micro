# Rollback Procedures

Learn how to implement effective rollback procedures to quickly recover from failed deployments and maintain application availability.

## Overview

Rollback procedures are critical for maintaining system stability when deployments fail or introduce issues. This guide covers various rollback strategies and automation techniques.

## Quick Rollback Commands

### Kubernetes Deployment Rollback
```bash
# Check rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp

# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp

# Rollback to specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp --to-revision=2

# Check rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
```

### ArgoCD Rollback
```bash
# Sync to previous commit
argocd app sync myapp --revision HEAD~1

# Check application health
argocd app get myapp
```

## Automated Rollback Triggers

### Health Check Based
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rollback-config
data:
  health_check_url: "http://myapp:8080/health"
  failure_threshold: "3"
  check_interval: "30s"
```

### Metrics Based
```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: rollback-alerts
spec:
  groups:
  - name: deployment.rules
    rules:
    - alert: HighErrorRate
      expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
      for: 2m
      annotations:
        summary: "High error rate detected - consider rollback"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Automated Testing**: Implement comprehensive health checks
2. **Quick Detection**: Set up proper monitoring and alerting
3. **Clear Procedures**: Document rollback steps and responsibilities
4. **Testing**: Regularly test rollback procedures
5. **Communication**: Establish clear incident response protocols

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Rollback Fails**: Check resource constraints and permissions
- **Data Inconsistency**: Verify database compatibility
- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure dependent services are compatible
