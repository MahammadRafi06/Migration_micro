# Automated Deployment Pipelines

Learn how to implement robust automated deployment pipelines that streamline your application delivery process while maintaining reliability and security.

## Overview

Automated deployment pipelines are essential for maintaining consistent, reliable, and fast application delivery. This guide covers best practices for implementing automated deployments specifically tailored for edge computing environments.

## Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: Eliminates manual deployment errors.
- **Speed**: Faster time-to-production.
- **Reliability**: Repeatable deployment processes.
- **Audibility**: Complete deployment history and rollback capabilities.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Source Control Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions pipeline trigger
name: Deploy Application
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

### 2. Build Stage

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker tag myapp:${{ github.sha }} myapp:latest
```

### 3. Testing Integration

```yaml
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker run --rm myapp:${{ github.sha }} npm test
          docker run --rm myapp:${{ github.sha }} npm run security-audit
```

### 4. Deployment Stage

```yaml
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }}
          kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
```

## Popular CI/CD Tools

### GitHub Actions
- Native GitHub integration.
- Extensive marketplace of actions.
- Built-in secrets management.

### GitLab CI/CD
- Integrated with GitLab repositories.
- Built-in container registry.
- Advanced deployment strategies.

### Jenkins
- Highly customizable.
- Extensive plugin ecosystem.
- Self-hosted or cloud options.

### ArgoCD
- GitOps-focused deployment.
- Kubernetes-native.
- Declarative configuration.

## Security Considerations

### Image Scanning
```yaml
      - name: Scan image for vulnerabilities
        uses: aquasec/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: 'myapp:${{ github.sha }}'
          format: 'sarif'
```

### Secret Management
- Use platform-provided secret management.
- Rotate secrets regularly.
- Never commit secrets to source control.

### Access Controls
- Implement least-privilege access.
- Use service accounts for automation.
- Regular access reviews.

## Edge-Specific Considerations

### Bandwidth Optimization
- Minimize image sizes.
- Use multi-stage builds.
- Leverage image layer caching.

### Connectivity Resilience
- Handle intermittent connectivity.
- Implement deployment retries.
- Use local caching strategies.

### Resource Constraints
- Optimize for limited resources.
- Implement resource quotas.
- Monitor deployment impact.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Deployment Metrics
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: deployment-metrics
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    name: metrics
  selector:
    app: myapp
```

### Health Checks
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic pipelines and iterate.
2. **Test Everything**: Include comprehensive testing in pipelines.
3. **Monitor Actively**: Track deployment success rates and performance.
4. **Document Processes**: Maintain clear deployment documentation.
5. **Plan for Failure**: Implement robust rollback mechanisms.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check dependencies and build environment.
- **Test Failures**: Verify test environment configuration.
- **Deployment Timeouts**: Adjust timeout values and resource limits.
- **Resource Conflicts**: Check for naming conflicts and resource availability.

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check pipeline status
kubectl get deployments
kubectl describe deployment myapp

# View deployment logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/myapp

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods
kubectl top nodes
```
