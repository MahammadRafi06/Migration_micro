# Platform Deep Dive & Advanced Concepts

This section provides comprehensive technical guidance for advanced platform capabilities, covering networking, security, storage, and observability patterns specific to edge computing environments.

## What You'll Learn

This deep dive covers the technical implementation details and best practices for:

### A. Networking & Connectivity
Advanced networking concepts for edge deployments, including ingress/egress management, service mesh integration, network policies, and edge-specific networking considerations.

### B. Security & Compliance
Comprehensive security frameworks covering identity and access management, secrets management, image security, network security, and compliance certifications.

### C. Storage & Data Management
Storage solutions and data management strategies including persistent storage options, database services, data synchronization, and backup/restore procedures.

### D. Observability & Monitoring
Complete observability stack implementation covering logging, metrics, tracing, alerting, dashboards, and platform-level monitoring.

### E. Armada Platform Components
Core Armada platform components including Galleon orchestration engine, Atlas operational insights, and marketplace integration capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into these advanced concepts, ensure you have:

### Foundation Knowledge
- Completed the [Getting Started](../getting-started/platform-overview) section
- Understanding of [Microservices Fundamentals](../application-modernization/microservice-fundamentals)
- Experience with basic Kubernetes operations

### Environment Setup
- Familiarity with your target deployment environment
- Access to platform administrative tools
- Understanding of infrastructure requirements

## Architecture Overview

The Edge Platform provides a comprehensive cloud-native foundation built on:

### Platform Layers
