# Platform-Level Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring for platform infrastructure and overall system health.

## Infrastructure Monitoring

### Node Health
```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: node-exporter
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-exporter
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
```

### Cluster Resources
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kube-state-metrics
spec:
  selector:
    app: kube-state-metrics
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    name: metrics
```

## Key Metrics

- **Node Status**: Monitor node availability and health.
- **Resource Utilization**: Track CPU, memory, and storage usage.
- **Network Performance**: Monitor bandwidth and latency.
- **Service Health**: Track service availability and response times.

## Best Practices

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Set up predictive alerts.
2. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource trends.
3. **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health checks.
4. **Historical Data**: Maintain long-term metrics.
